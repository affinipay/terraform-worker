Configuration Concepts
======================

The **terraform-worker** is a terraform wrapper which emphasizes configuration simplicity for 
complex orchestrations.  The **terraform-worker** works by reading a configuration of terraform
provider, variable and module :ref:`definitions`, gathering provider plugins and remote terraform
sources, and then serially executing the terraform operations in a local temporary directory. The
**terraform-worker** supports passing orchestration values through a pipeline of terraform operations
via the `data\.terraform_remote_state <https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/remote-state-data.html>`_
data source. This section examines **terraform-worker** concepts of :ref:`rendering`, :ref:`definitions`,
:ref:`terraform-vars`, :ref:`remote-vars`, and :ref:`provider-configurations`.

.. _rendering:

Rendering with Jinja templates
-------------------------------

**terraform-worker** configurations are pre-processed using the `Jinja <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/>`_
templating language. This allows interpolation of values passed in from the command line.

.. note:: 

   Expansion of a variable passed in from the CLI:

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 5

      providers:
        aws:
          vars:
            version: ">= 3.16.0"
            region: {{ aws_region }}

**terraform-worker** supports a special ``env`` object for interpolating values passed in the environment.

.. note::

   Expansion of a variable passed in from the environment:

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 4-5

      definitions:
        blue:
          terraform_vars:
            name: {{ env.NAME_VAR|default("alpha") }}
            tag: {{ env.TAG_VAR|default("beta") }}

Pre-processing with Jinja allows for the use of conditional blocks. Conditional blocks might be keyed on a
:ref:`config-var` passed via the CLI.

.. note::

   Following is an example of Jinaja conditional blocks applied to terraform variable configuration.

   .. code-block:: jinja
      :emphasize-lines: 4-8

      definitions:
        blue:
          path: /definitions/charts
          terraform_vars:
            {% if env.CHART_HOME is defined and env.CHART_HOME %}
            chart_base_path: "{{ env.CHART_HOME }}/helm-charts"
            {% else %}
            chart_base_path: "{{ env.HOME }}/helm-charts"
            {% endif %}
            homedir: {{ env.HOME }}

The deployment being run (the ``deployment`` argument of ``terraform``, ``clean`` and ``env``) is available as
``deployment``. It takes precedence over a :ref:`config-var` with the same name.

.. note::

   Expansion of the deployment:

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 4

      definitions:
        blue:
          terraform_vars:
            deployment: {{ deployment }}

   single: worker options

.. _worker-options:

Stipulating options in the configuration file
---------------------------------------------

In addition to using command line options, worker configuration can be specified using a ``worker_options`` section in
the worker configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    terraform:
      worker_options:
        backend: s3
        backend_prefix: tfstate
        terraform_bin: /home/user/bin/terraform

      providers:
      ...

**terraform-worker** requires a configuration file.  By default, it will looks for a file named "worker.yaml" in the
current working directory.  Together with the ``worker_options`` listed above, it's possible to specify all options 
either in the environment or in the configuration file and simply call the worker command by itself.

.. code-block:: bash

    % env | grep AWS
    AWS_PROFILE=a-great-profile

    % head ./worker.yaml
    terraform:
      worker_options:
        backend: s3
        backend_prefix: tfstate
        terraform_bin: /home/user/bin/terraform

    # The following command does not pass apply, so tf operations are only planned.
    % worker terraform my-deploy --no-clean

.. index::
   single: provider configurations

.. _provider-configurations:

Provider Configurations
-----------------------

A **terraform-worker** configuration must include information about the providers that are used by the
definitions. The **terraform-worker** uses this information to download all plugins locally and then
passes the local path to each terraform operation.

Provider configurations typically include the version and any other configuration variables the provider
may require. These values should be declared in a ``vars`` dictionary as an immediate child of provider-named
dictionary.

.. note::

    Following is a ``providers`` snippet from a configuration.

    .. code-block:: yaml
       :emphasize-lines: 2-9

       terraform:
         providers:
           aws:
             vars:
               version: ">= 3.16.0"
               region: {{ aws_region }}
           'null':
             vars:
               version: ">= 3.0.0"

    Following is how the ``region`` variable from the **aws** provider configuration listed above is rendered
    in the terraform ``provider`` block.

    .. code-block:: terraform

        provider "aws" {
          region = "us-west-2"
        }

If the provider is not available from the hashicorp registry, it is also possible to explicitly stipulate
the provider download location using a ``baseURL`` field in the provider dictionary.

.. note::

   Following is an example of a ``baseURL`` configuration.

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 4

      terraform:
        providers:
          kubectl:
            baseURL: https://github.com/gavinbunney/terraform-provider-kubectl/releases/download/v1.9.4
            vars:
              version: "1.9.4"

.. index::
   single: definition

.. _definitions:

Definitions
-----------

A **terraform-worker** configuration is comprised of one or more definition statements. Conceptually, a 
**definition** may refer to either the statement in the configuration, or a collection of terraform and 
supporting files on a file system, or in a git repository. In general, these latter **definitions** are
lightweight.  They are mainly involved aggregating the parameters that will be supplied to an underlying
terraform module as inputs.

.. _definition-statements:

Definition Statements
+++++++++++++++++++++

A **definition statement** is `key` in a :ref:`definitions` object in a **terraform-worker** configuration.
A **definition statement** must include a `key` which defines either a locally relative :ref:`filesystem-definition`
or a path to a git repository.

.. note:: Following is an example of a definitions statement, "ami". 

   .. code-block:: yaml

      definitions:
        ami:
          path: /definitions/new-ami
          terraform_vars:
            name: {{ env.NAME_VAR|default("alpha") }}
            tag: {{ env.TAG_VAR|default("beta") }}

.. _filesystem-definition:

Filesystem Definition
+++++++++++++++++++++

A **filesystem definition** refers to a directory which includes a terraform root module.  Optionally, it may also
include a :ref:`hooks` directory.

.. note::

   Following is the directory tree of a sample definition.

   .. code-block:: bash

      definitions/new-ami
      ├── README.md
      ├── hooks
      │   ├── images
      │   │   └── image.pkr.hcl
      │   └── scripts
      │       └── setup.sh
      ├── main.tf
      └── outputs.tf

.. index::
   single: definitions sources

.. _definitions-sources:

Definitions Sources
+++++++++++++++++++

A **definitions source** generates definition statements when the configuration is loaded, instead of
listing them by hand. Sources are declared in a ``definitions_sources`` object; each entry supports:

- ``path`` (required): a local path or git URL, resolved and fetched exactly like a definition ``path``.
- ``remote_path_options`` (optional): ``branch`` and ``sub_path``, as for a definition.
- ``command`` (required): the command that prints the definitions.
- ``after`` (optional): the definition the generated definitions are inserted after.

.. note::

   Following is an example of a definitions source.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      terraform:
        definitions_sources:
          catalog:
            path: git@github.com:example/service-catalog.git
            remote_path_options:
              branch: main
            command: bin/list-definitions
            after: network

        definitions:
          network:
            path: /definitions/aws/network-existing
          database:
            path: /definitions/aws/rds

   If ``bin/list-definitions`` prints:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      queue: {}
      api:
        remote_vars:
          subnet: network.outputs.subnet_id

   the definitions run in the order ``network``, ``queue``, ``api``, ``database``, and ``queue`` and ``api`` are
   fetched from ``git@github.com:example/service-catalog.git`` on branch ``main``.

Sources are processed for every command that loads the configuration (``terraform``, ``clean`` and ``env``),
after all configuration files are rendered and merged and before the configuration is validated. Generated
definitions are therefore treated like configured ones everywhere, including by ``--limit`` and handlers.

For each source, in configuration order:

#. The source is copied to ``<working-dir>/definitions_sources/<name>``. With ``sub_path``, only that
   subdirectory is copied.
#. ``command`` runs in the copy. The command is part of the configuration, so it is rendered with Jinja like
   everything else; it is split into arguments shell-style and run without a shell, so pipes and redirection
   are not available. A relative executable such as ``bin/list-definitions`` resolves against the copy and must
   be executable. The command inherits the worker's environment, plus ``WORKER_DEPLOYMENT`` set to the
   deployment.
#. Standard output is parsed as YAML (JSON is valid YAML): a mapping of definition name to definition body.
   Empty output generates no definitions, and a name with a null body is treated as ``{}``. Standard error is
   logged at debug level.
#. A generated definition without its own ``path`` gets the source's ``path`` and, if it has no
   ``remote_path_options`` of its own, the source's ``remote_path_options`` (only the options that are set,
   including ``sub_path``). A definition with its own ``path`` is left unchanged.
#. The generated definitions are inserted, in the order printed, immediately after the ``after``
   definition, or at the end of ``definitions`` when ``after`` is not set. ``after`` may name a definition
   generated by an earlier source.

Deciding what counts as an error is the command's job; the worker only fails on a non-zero exit. Any of the
following stops the worker with exit code 1 and an error naming the source:

- the source cannot be fetched (clone failure, unknown path type, missing local path);
- the command cannot be run (missing or not executable);
- the command exits non-zero (the error includes its exit code and standard error);
- the output is not valid YAML/JSON, or is not a mapping of names to mappings;
- ``after`` names a definition that does not exist;
- a generated name matches a configured definition, or is generated by two sources;
- a source entry has an unknown key or is missing ``path`` or ``command``.

.. warning::

   The command runs with the worker's environment and credentials. Only point a definitions source at
   repositories you trust as much as the configuration itself.

   single: terraform_vars

.. _terraform-vars:

Terraform Variables
-------------------

The ``terraform_vars`` field  in a **terraform-worker** configuration is used to express an input
variables or local variables for a terraform module. Values which appear in this block are passed to
the underlying terraform operation in a ``worker.auto.tfvars`` file.

.. note::

   Following is a ``terraform_vars`` snippet from a configuration.

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 5-7

      terraform:
        ...
        definitions:
          blue:
            terraform_vars:
              name: alpha
              tag: beta
      ...

   Following is how this value appears in the terraform execution environment.

   .. code-block:: bash

      % pwd
      /tmp/fhgwjxkt/definitions/blue
      % cat worker.auto.tfvars
      name = "alpha"
      tag = "beta"

.. index::
   single: remote_vars

.. _remote-vars:

Remote Variables
----------------

A ``remote_vars`` field in a **terraform-worker** configuration is used to express input or local
variables that will be supplied from terraform's backend state store.

.. note::

   Following is a ``remote_vars`` snippet from a configuration.

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 10,11

      ...
      terraform:
        ...
        definitions:
          tagging:
            # This definition includes an output value for tagmap
            path: /definitions/tagging

          blue:
            remote_vars:
              tags: tagging.output.tagmap
      ...

   Following is how this value appears in the terraform execution environment.

   .. code-block:: bash

      % pwd
      /tmp/tsgsdh6t/definitions/blue
      % cat worker-locals.tf
      locals {
        tags = data.terraform_remote_state.tagging.output.tagmap
      }

.. index::
   single: terraform modules

.. _terraform-modules:

Terraform Modules
-----------------

The **terraform-worker** can be made aware of a local repository of terraform-modules.  Locally defined
terraform modules are copied into the same directory as a **terraform-worker** definition, so that they
are available within a definition's terraform code at the path: ``./terraform-modules``.

The location of a local repository of terraform-modules can be specified using the
:ref:`terraform-modules-dir` command line option.
